# 01. Bit Manipulation

## Theory

### Description

Bit manipulation refers to using bitwise operators to work directly with the binary representations of numbers. These operations allow you to solve problems efficiently, often with a time complexity advantage compared to other methods. In many cases, bit manipulation can help reduce both time and space complexity, especially when working with binary data.

### Common Bitwise Operators

1. **AND (`&`)**: Sets a bit to 1 if both corresponding bits are 1.  
    
    - Example: `1101 & 1011 = 1001` (binary)

2. **OR (`|`)**: Sets a bit to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits is 1.  
    
    - Example: `1101 | 1011 = 1111`

3. **XOR (`^`)**: Sets a bit to 1 if the corresponding bits are different.  
    
    - Example: `1101 ^ 1011 = 0110`

4. **NOT (`~`)**: Flips all bits (inverts 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s).  
    
    - Example: `~1101 = 0010` (assuming 4-bit representation)

5. **Left Shift (`<<`)**: Shifts bits to the left, equivalent to multiplying the number by 2.  
    
    - Example: `1010 << 1 = 10100` (multiplies by 2)

6. **Right Shift (`>>`)**: Shifts bits to the right, equivalent to dividing the number by 2 (ignoring the remainder).  

    - Example: `1010 >> 1 = 0101` (divides by 2)

### Key Bit Manipulation Patterns

1. **Check if a number is even or odd**:
    - Use `n & 1`. If the result is `0`, the number is even; if the result is `1`, the number is odd.
    - **Example**:  
        `n = 5` → `5 & 1 = 1` → Odd  
        `n = 6` → `6 & 1 = 0` → Even

2. **Get the rightmost set bit**:
    - To isolate the rightmost set bit (1) in a number, use `n & (-n)`.
    - **Example**:  
        `n = 12` (binary `1100`) → `n & (-n) = 4` (binary `0100`)

3. **Set the k-th bit**:
    - To set (turn to 1) the k-th bit(0-indexing, right to left) of a number `n`, use `n | (1 << k)`.
    - **Example**:  
        `n = 4` (binary `0100`), set the 3nd bit: `4 | (1 << 3) = 4 | 8 = 12` (binary `1100`)

4. **Clear the k-th bit**:
    - To clear (turn to 0) the k-th bit, use `n & ~(1 << k)`.
    - **Example**:  
        `n = 6` (binary `0110`), clear the 2nd bit: `6 & ~(1 << 2) = 6 & ~4 = 6 & 11 = 2` (binary `0010`)

5. **Toggle the k-th bit**:
    - To flip (toggle) the k-th bit, use `n ^ (1 << k)`. This changes a 1 to 0, or a 0 to 1.
    - **Example**:  
        `n = 6` (binary `0110`), toggle the 2nd bit: `6 ^ (1 << 2) = 6 ^ 4 = 2` (binary `0010`)

6. **Check if the k-th bit is set**:
    - To check if the k-th bit is 1, use `(n & (1 << k)) != 0`. If the result is non-zero, the k-th bit is set.
    - **Example**:  
        `n = 6` (binary `0110`), check if the 2nd bit is set: `(6 & (1 << 2)) != 0` → True

7. **Count the number of set bits (Hamming Weight)**:
    - To count the number of set bits (1s) in a number, use the technique `n = n & (n - 1)` repeatedly. This removes the rightmost set bit in each step. Count how many times you can do this until `n` becomes 0.
    - **Example**:  
        `n = 13` (binary `1101`):  
        First step: `n = 13 & 12 = 1101 & 1100 = 1100`  
        Second step: `n = 12 & 11 = 1100 & 1011 = 1000`  
        Third step: `n = 8 & 7 = 1000 & 0111 = 0000`  
        Total steps: 3 set bits.

8. **Power of 2 Check**:
    - A number `n` is a power of 2 if it has exactly one set bit. Check if `n & (n - 1) == 0` (and `n > 0` to exclude 0).
    - **Example**:  
        `n = 8` (binary `1000`), check if it's a power of 2:  
        `8 & (8 - 1) = 8 & 7 = 0` → True (8 is a power of 2).

### Intuitive Applications of Bit Manipulation

1. **Subset Generation**:
    - each subset of a set can be represented as a binary number. For a set with n elements, there are 2^n subsets, and each subset corresponds to a number between 0 and 2^n - 1.

    - Masking: Each number (mask) from 0 to 2^n - 1 is used to generate a subset. The i-th bit in the number indicates whether the i-th element is in the subset (1 for included, 0 for excluded).
        ```python linenums="1"
        def generate_subsets(nums):
        n = len(nums)
        subsets = []
        for mask in range(1 << n):  # Loop over all subsets
            subset = [nums[i] for i in range(n) if mask & (1 << i)]  # Build subset
            subsets.append(subset)
        return subsets

        nums = [1, 2, 3]
        subsets = generate_subsets(nums)
        ```

    - **Example**: For the set `{1, 2, 3}`, the subsets are:
        - `000` → `{}` (empty set)
        - `001` → `{1}`
        - `010` → `{2}`
        - `011` → `{1,2}`
        - `100` → `{3}`
        - `101` → `{1, 3}`
        - `110` → `{2, 3}`
        - `111` → `{1, 2, 3}`

2. **Efficient Swapping**:
    - You can swap two numbers using XOR without needing a temporary variable:
    ```python linenums="1"
        a = a ^ b
        b = a ^ b
        a = a ^ b
    ```
    - **Example**: If `a = 5` and `b = 3`, the values of `a` and `b` will be swapped using this XOR trick.

### Why Use Bit Manipulation?

1. **Efficiency**: Bitwise operations are generally faster because they directly manipulate individual bits, which is low-level and quick.
2. **Memory Optimization**: You can use fewer resources (like using a bitmask instead of an array of booleans).
3. **Elegance**: Many problems become simpler and cleaner when you think in terms of binary data and bitwise operations.
