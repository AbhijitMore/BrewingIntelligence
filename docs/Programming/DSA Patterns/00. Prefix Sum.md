# 00. Prefix Sum & Line Swipe

## Prefix Sum 
### Theory

#### Description

The prefix sum technique allows for efficient range sum queries by precomputing cumulative sums in an array.

#### Steps
1. **Build the Prefix Sum Array:**  
Create a new array `prefix` where each element at index `i` stores the sum of elements from the start of the array up to index `i`:  
```python
prefix[0] = arr[0]
prefix[1] = arr[0] + arr[1]
prefix[2] = arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2] 
```
And so on…<br>
**Example:**  
For `arr = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]`, the `prefix_sum` array is `[3, 4, 8, 9, 14, 23]`.  
2. **Answer Range Sum Queries:**  
To find the sum of elements between indices `i` and `j`, use:  
`sum(i, j) = prefix[j] - prefix[i-1]`  

**Example:**  
For `arr = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]`, the sum from index `2` to `4`:  
`sum(2, 4) = prefix[4] - prefix[1] = 14 - 4 = 10`.
!!! note "Note"
    If `i = 0`, simply return `prefix[j]`.

#### Time & Space Complexity  
* Time: `O(n)` for building the prefix sum array, `O(1)` per query.  
* Space: `O(n)` for storing the prefix sum array.  

### Problems

#### 1. Range Sum Query - Immutable ([Leetcode:303](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-query-immutable/description/))

**Problem Statement**  
Given an integer array `nums`, handle multiple queries of the following type:  

Calculate the sum of the elements of nums between indices `left` and `right` **inclusive** where `left` <= `right`.  

Implement the `NumArray` class:  

* `NumArray(int[] nums)` Initializes the object with the integer array `nums`.
* `int sumRange(int left, int right)` Returns the sum of the elements of nums between indices `left` and `right` inclusive (i.e. `nums[left] + nums[left + 1] + ... + nums[right])`.

**Example 1:**  
> **Input**  
> `["NumArray", "sumRange", "sumRange", "sumRange"]`  
> `[[[-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1]], [0, 2], [2, 5], [0, 5]]`  
> **Output**  
> `[null, 1, -1, -3]`  

> **Explanation**  
> NumArray numArray = new NumArray([-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1]);  
> numArray.sumRange(0, 2); // return (-2) + 0 + 3 = 1  
> numArray.sumRange(2, 5); // return 3 + (-5) + 2 + (-1) = -1  
> numArray.sumRange(0, 5); // return (-2) + 0 + 3 + (-5) + 2 + (-1) = -3  

**Constraints:**

> * `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
> * `-105 <= nums[i] <= 105`
> * `0 <= left <= right < nums.length`
> * `At most 104 calls will be made to sumRange.`

??? note "Code & Explaination"
    ```python linenums="1"
    class NumArray:

    def __init__(self, nums: List[int]):
        self.prefix_sum = [0] * (len(nums)+1)

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            self.prefix_sum[i+1] = self.prefix_sum[i] + nums[i]

    def sumRange(self, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        return self.prefix_sum[right+1]-self.prefix_sum[left]
    ```
    **Explaination**

    1. Constructor (`__init__`):  
        - Initializes a list `prefix_sum` where `prefix_sum[i]` stores the sum of the elements from index `0` to `i-1`.  
        - Builds this `prefix_sum` array by iterating over the input list `nums`.
        
    2. Method `sumRange(left, right)` :  
        - Returns the sum of the subarray between indices left and right by calculating the difference:  
        `prefix_sum[right+1] - prefix_sum[left].`  
        - This allows constant time `O(1)` querying of subarray sums after the initial setup.

#### 2. Left and Right Sum Differences ([Leetcode:2574](https://leetcode.com/problems/left-and-right-sum-differences/description/))
**Problem Statement**  
Given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`, find a 0-indexed integer array `answer` where:  

* `answer.length == nums.length`.  
* `answer[i] = |leftSum[i] - rightSum[i]|`. 

Where:

* `leftSum[i]` is the sum of elements to the left of the index `i` in the array `nums`. If there is no such element, `leftSum[i] = 0`.  
* `rightSum[i]` is the sum of elements to the right of the index `i` in the array `nums`. If there is no such element, `rightSum[i] = 0`.  
Return the array `answer`.  

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** nums = [10,4,8,3]  
> **Output:** [15,1,11,22]  
> **Explanation:** The array leftSum is [0,10,14,22] and the array rightSum is [15,11,3,0].  
> The array answer is [|0 - 15|,|10 - 11|,|14 - 3|,|22 - 0|] = [15,1,11,22].  



**Example 2:**

> **Input:** nums = [1]  
> **Output:** [0]  
> **Explanation:** The array leftSum is [0] and the array rightSum is [0].  
> The array answer is [|0 - 0|] = [0].  

**Constraints:**  

> * `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
> * `1 <= nums[i] <= 105`


??? note "code & Explanation"
    ```python linenums="1" 
    class Solution:
    def leftRightDifference(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        
        left_sum  = 0
        right_sum = sum(nums)
        answer = []

        for num in nums:
            left_sum += num
            answer.append(abs(left_sum-right_sum))
            right_sum -= num

        return answer
    ```
    **Explaination**

    1. Initialization :  
        - `left_sum = 0`: Tracks the sum of elements before the current index.  
        - `right_sum = sum(nums)`: Initially holds the total sum of all elements.  
        - `answer = []`: Stores the result.

    2. Loop through nums :  
        - For each element `num`:  
        - Update `left_sum`: Add `num` to `left_sum`.  
        - Calculate and append absolute difference: `|left_sum - right_sum|` is appended to `answer`.  
        - Update `right_sum`: Subtract `num` from `right_sum`.

    3. Return answer :  
        - After the loop, return the computed differences in `answer`.


#### 3. XOR Queries of a Subarray ([Leetcode:1310](https://leetcode.com/problems/xor-queries-of-a-subarray/description/))
**Problem Statement**  

You are given an array `arr` of positive integers. You are also given the array `queries` where `queries[i] = [lefti, righti]`.

For each query `i` compute the XOR of elements from `lefti` to `righti` (that is, `arr[lefti] XOR arr[lefti + 1] XOR ... XOR arr[righti]` ).

Return an array `answer` where `answer[i]` is the answer to the `ith` query.

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** `arr = [1,3,4,8]`, `queries = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,3],[3,3]]`  
> **Output:** `[2,7,14,8]`  
> **Explanation:** The binary representation of the elements in the array are:  
1 = 0001  
3 = 0011  
4 = 0100  
8 = 1000  
The XOR values for queries are:  
[0,1] = 1 xor 3 = 2  
[1,2] = 3 xor 4 = 7  
[0,3] = 1 xor 3 xor 4 xor 8 = 14  
[3,3] = 8```  

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** arr = [4,8,2,10], queries = [[2,3],[1,3],[0,0],[0,3]]  
> **Output:** [8,0,4,4]

**Constraints:**  

> - `1 <= arr.length, queries.length <= 3 * 104`
> - `1 <= arr[i] <= 109`
> - `queries[i].length == 2`
> - `0 <= lefti <= righti < arr.length`


??? note "Code & Explaination"
    ```python linenums="1"
    class Solution:
        def xorQueries(self, arr: List[int], queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
            
            prefix = [0] * (len(arr) + 1)
            answer = []

            for i in range(len(arr)):
                prefix[i + 1] = prefix[i] ^ arr[i]

            for left, right in queries:
                answer.append(prefix[right + 1] ^ prefix[left])

            return answer
    ```
    **Explaination:**<br><br>

    1. Initialization:
        - `prefix = [0] * (len(arr) + 1)`: Create a list `prefix` to store the cumulative XOR of elements in the array. The extra element accounts for the starting point (index 0).  
        - `answer = []`: This will store the result for each query.

    2. Build Prefix XOR Array:
        - For each element `arr[i]` in the array, compute the cumulative XOR up to that index:
        - `prefix[i + 1] = prefix[i] ^ arr[i]`: This updates the `prefix` list, where each entry at `i + 1` holds the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to index `i`.

    3. Process Queries:
        - For each query `[left, right]`, calculate the XOR of elements from index `left` to `right`:
        - `answer.append(prefix[right + 1] ^ prefix[left])`: This uses the precomputed `prefix` array. The XOR of the subarray from `left` to `right` is found by subtracting the prefix XORs at `left` and `right + 1`.

    4. Return the Answer:
        - The final `answer` list contains the result for each query, which is the XOR of the elements in the subarray defined by `left` and `right`.

#### 4. Subarray Sum Equals K ([Leetcode:560](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/description/))
**Problem Statement**  
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return the total number of subarrays whose sum equals to `k`.  

A subarray is a contiguous `non-empty` sequence of elements within an array.

**Example 1:**  
> Input: nums = [1,1,1], k = 2  
> Output: 2

**Example 2:**  
> Input: nums = [1,2,3], k = 3  
> Output: 2

**Constraints:**  

> * `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104`
> * `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
> * `-107 <= k <= 107`

??? note "Code & Explaination"
    ```python linenums="1"
    class Solution:
        def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
            count = 0
            prefix_sum = 0
            dictionary = {0:1}  # Start with {0:1} to handle subarrays starting from the beginning

            for num in nums:
                prefix_sum += num  # Update prefix sum
                diff = prefix_sum - k  # Find the difference between the current prefix sum and target k
                if diff in dictionary:  # If this diff has been seen before, increment count
                    count += dictionary[diff]
                dictionary[prefix_sum] = dictionary.get(prefix_sum, 0) + 1  # Update the dictionary

            return count
    ```
    **Explaination:**<br>

    1. Initialization:  
        - `count = 0`: To store the number of valid subarrays.  
        - `prefix_sum = 0`: To keep track of the cumulative sum as we iterate through the array.  
        - `dictionary = {0: 1}`: This keeps track of how many times a certain prefix sum has occurred.  
        - We start with `{0: 1}` because a sum of `0` is possible before we start processing the array.

    2. Iterate through the array:  
        - For each element `num` in the array, update the `prefix_sum` by adding `num` to it.  
        - Compute the difference `diff = prefix_sum - k`. If `diff` exists in the dictionary, it means there are subarrays whose sum equals `k`, and their `count` is stored in the `dictionary`.  
        - Increment `count` by the number of times `diff` has occurred.  
        - Update the dictionary by increasing the `count` of `prefix_sum`.
        
    3. Return the `count`:  
        - This gives the total number of subarrays whose sum equals `k`.

## Line Sweep

### Theory

#### Description

The **Line Sweep Algorithm** is a powerful technique used in computational geometry. It's an efficient way to solve problems like detecting intersections, finding the closest pair of points, or calculating the convex hull. Let’s break down the core concepts of this algorithm to understand how it works.

#### What is the Sweep Line?

The **sweep line** is an imaginary vertical line that moves across a plane from left to right. As it moves, it sweeps through the objects in its path, processing important events at each step. Imagine it like a curtain slowly moving across a stage, revealing different parts of a scene. In the context of algorithms, this "curtain" moves across the plane, checking and reacting to specific points where events occur.

The sweep line doesn’t just move randomly—it advances through key points, called **events**, which are defined based on the specific problem being solved. By focusing on these events, the algorithm can efficiently process only the relevant parts of the data.

#### What are Events?

An **event** is a point on the plane where something significant happens as the sweep line moves. These events are the heart of the algorithm because they trigger actions like adding or removing objects, or checking for interactions. Depending on the problem you're solving, events could include:

- **Start events**: The beginning of an object, such as the left endpoint of a line segment or the opening of a rectangle.
- **End events**: The end of an object, like the right endpoint of a line segment or the closing of a rectangle.
- **Intersection events**: When two objects, like two line segments, intersect or overlap.

The sweep line processes these events in order, one by one, and each event may lead to an update in the algorithm’s state—whether it’s adding a new object, removing one, or checking for an intersection.

#### How Does it Work?

Here’s how the line sweep algorithm works in practice:

- **Sort the events**: The first step is to sort all the events in order of their position along the x-axis (left to right). For example, if you are working with line segments, this would mean sorting by the x-coordinate of the start and end points of each segment.

- **Process events in order**: The sweep line starts at the leftmost event and moves to the right. For each event, you do something specific:
  - When the sweep line reaches a **start event** (like the left endpoint of a line segment), the segment is added to a list of active objects.
  - When the sweep line reaches an **end event** (like the right endpoint), that segment is removed from the list of active objects.
  - At each step, the algorithm may check for **intersections** or other interactions between active objects (e.g., checking if newly added segments intersect with others already in the list).

By sorting and processing events in this way, the algorithm can handle complex geometric problems without having to check every possible pair of objects, which would be much slower.
