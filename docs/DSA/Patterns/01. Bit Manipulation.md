# 01. Bit Manipulation

## Theory

### Description

Bit manipulation refers to using bitwise operators to work directly with the binary representations of numbers. These operations allow you to solve problems efficiently, often with a time complexity advantage compared to other methods. In many cases, bit manipulation can help reduce both time and space complexity, especially when working with binary data.

### Common Bitwise Operators

1. **AND (`&`)**: Sets a bit to 1 if both corresponding bits are 1.  
    
    - Example: `1101 & 1011 = 1001` (binary)

2. **OR (`|`)**: Sets a bit to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits is 1.  
    
    - Example: `1101 | 1011 = 1111`

3. **XOR (`^`)**: Sets a bit to 1 if the corresponding bits are different.  
    
    - Example: `1101 ^ 1011 = 0110`

4. **NOT (`~`)**: Flips all bits (inverts 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s).  
    
    - Example: `~1101 = 0010` (assuming 4-bit representation)

5. **Left Shift (`<<`)**: Shifts bits to the left, equivalent to multiplying the number by 2.  
    
    - Example: `1010 << 1 = 10100` (multiplies by 2)

6. **Right Shift (`>>`)**: Shifts bits to the right, equivalent to dividing the number by 2 (ignoring the remainder).  

    - Example: `1010 >> 1 = 0101` (divides by 2)

### Key Bit Manipulation Patterns

1. **Check if a number is even or odd**:
    - Use `n & 1`. If the result is `0`, the number is even; if the result is `1`, the number is odd.
    - **Example**:  
        `n = 5` → `5 & 1 = 1` → Odd  
        `n = 6` → `6 & 1 = 0` → Even

2. **Get the rightmost set bit**:
    - To isolate the rightmost set bit (1) in a number, use `n & (-n)`.
    - **Example**:  
        `n = 12` (binary `1100`) → `n & (-n) = 4` (binary `0100`)

3. **Set the k-th bit**:
    - To set (turn to 1) the k-th bit of a number `n`, use `n | (1 << k)`.
    - **Example**:  
        `n = 6` (binary `0110`), set the 2nd bit: `6 | (1 << 2) = 6 | 4 = 6` (binary `1110`)

4. **Clear the k-th bit**:
    - To clear (turn to 0) the k-th bit, use `n & ~(1 << k)`.
    - **Example**:  
        `n = 6` (binary `0110`), clear the 2nd bit: `6 & ~(1 << 2) = 6 & ~4 = 6 & 11 = 2` (binary `0010`)

5. **Toggle the k-th bit**:
    - To flip (toggle) the k-th bit, use `n ^ (1 << k)`. This changes a 1 to 0, or a 0 to 1.
    - **Example**:  
        `n = 6` (binary `0110`), toggle the 2nd bit: `6 ^ (1 << 2) = 6 ^ 4 = 2` (binary `0010`)

6. **Check if the k-th bit is set**:
    - To check if the k-th bit is 1, use `(n & (1 << k)) != 0`. If the result is non-zero, the k-th bit is set.
    - **Example**:  
        `n = 6` (binary `0110`), check if the 2nd bit is set: `(6 & (1 << 2)) != 0` → True

7. **Count the number of set bits (Hamming Weight)**:
    - To count the number of set bits (1s) in a number, use the technique `n = n & (n - 1)` repeatedly. This removes the rightmost set bit in each step. Count how many times you can do this until `n` becomes 0.
    - **Example**:  
        `n = 13` (binary `1101`):  
        First step: `n = 13 & 12 = 1101 & 1100 = 1100`  
        Second step: `n = 12 & 11 = 1100 & 1011 = 1000`  
        Third step: `n = 8 & 7 = 1000 & 0111 = 0000`  
        Total steps: 3 set bits.

8. **Power of 2 Check**:
    - A number `n` is a power of 2 if it has exactly one set bit. Check if `n & (n - 1) == 0` (and `n > 0` to exclude 0).
    - **Example**:  
        `n = 8` (binary `1000`), check if it's a power of 2:  
        `8 & (8 - 1) = 8 & 7 = 0` → True (8 is a power of 2).

### Intuitive Applications of Bit Manipulation

1. **Subset Generation**:
    - You can use bit manipulation to generate all subsets of a set. Each subset can be represented as a binary number where each bit indicates whether an element is included or not.
    - **Example**: For the set `{1, 2, 3}`, the subsets are:
        - `000` → `{}` (empty set)
        - `001` → `{3}`
        - `010` → `{2}`
        - `011` → `{2, 3}`
        - `100` → `{1}`
        - `101` → `{1, 3}`
        - `110` → `{1, 2}`
        - `111` → `{1, 2, 3}`

2. **Efficient Swapping**:
    - You can swap two numbers using XOR without needing a temporary variable:
        ``` 
        a = a ^ b
        b = a ^ b
        a = a ^ b
        ```
    - **Example**: If `a = 5` and `b = 3`, the values of `a` and `b` will be swapped using this XOR trick.

3. **Optimized Algorithms**:
    - Bit manipulation can often replace loops or division operations, making algorithms run faster, especially for tasks like finding specific bits, checking parity, or efficiently checking conditions.

### Why Use Bit Manipulation?

1. **Efficiency**: Bitwise operations are generally faster because they directly manipulate individual bits, which is low-level and quick.
2. **Memory Optimization**: You can use fewer resources (like using a bitmask instead of an array of booleans).
3. **Elegance**: Many problems become simpler and cleaner when you think in terms of binary data and bitwise operations.

By understanding and using bit manipulation, you can solve many problems more efficiently, especially those involving binary data or low-level optimizations. This pattern is especially useful in problems related to subsets, powers of 2, and counting set bits, which commonly appear in competitive programming and algorithm design.
