# 03. Fast and Slow Pointers

## Theory

### Description  
The Fast and Slow Pointer technique, also called the Tortoise and Hare algorithm, is a powerful method for efficiently solving problems in linked lists and cyclic structures.  

### How It Works  

* The slow pointer moves one step at a time.
* The fast pointer moves two steps at a time.

The difference in speeds allows the fast pointer to catch up with the slow pointer if thereâ€™s a cycle or to identify the middle of a structure.

### Key Insights

- Cycle Detection: If a cycle exists, the fast pointer will meet the slow pointer inside the cycle.
- Middle Element: The slow pointer will be at the middle when the fast pointer reaches the end.
- Pattern Matching: Helps detect patterns like palindromes by dividing the structure into two parts.

### Benefits

- Time Efficient: Solves problems in O(n) time with a single traversal.
- Space Efficient: Requires O(1) space, avoiding extra data structures.
- Simple & Elegant: Reduces complex problems to simple solutions.
